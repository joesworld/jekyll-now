  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Todays starting point was really, really annoying as I found out from my partner/friend that we were now meant to remember and understand the code so then after the Christmas holidays we can write our own code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Today my target was to really try to understand the code, so that in the future I can work more efficiently and therefore get a better grade in the future.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes both me and my partner reached my target and this was because we had a system going on that worked really well and this meant that i could reach the target that I set for myself at the beginning of the lesson.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The strategy or system that my partner and I worked and it was: that we would take turns copying down the code but at the same time we talked about what each individual thing did and of there was something that we were both unsure on then the person who was not writing down the code would search it up on the internet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think when we were discussing it we were making our answers well to long and this almost held us back because we were discussing it for longer so we had to rush to finish it but at the end of the day we did quite well so I think that it was a good lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am going to be honest and i would say that we need to have roles that help us because as much as taking turns with stuff is the right thing to do i am a quicker typer so the amount of work we will be able to do is more which will then mean that we can get more done and proceed to the more advanced work in the book.</td>
