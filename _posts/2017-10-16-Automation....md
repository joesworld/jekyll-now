**Automation… 							Monday 2nd October**

I am trying something different now, before I was setting my blogs up in a table, and although it looked good, I felt it was that professional so I am trying a new approach, let's see how it works out...

This week we worked on our spreadsheet up in such a way that it meant that wherever we typed information onto our buying sheet, it would come up with the price times the quantity whatever the thing you put in, as the formula is for the cell rather than what is in the cell. As well as doing this we worked out a proper way to display discount codes, so rather than it just being on the side and the codes being visible we used vlookup and iserror to properly format it. The iserror command allows us to control if the code entered is good or fake and it doesn't just go depending on the first two letters as it used to. 

I felt I did well in lesson today, and I think I have finally found something that I personally enjoy in IT. 

So that's it from me Joe Out…
