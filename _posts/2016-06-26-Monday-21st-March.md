Monday 21st March 

Today we looked some terrible examples of Prezis made by previous students doing that were at the school i am in and how they will just be plagiarized or how the colours will be too vibrant, all to keep in mind when making our own ones, as our teacher quoted. 

But the most scary part was left until last and it was the dreaded word HOMEWORK!!!!!!!!!!!! We have to make our own Prezi on the history of computers and how am i meant to that I already have lots to do, but I hope it is easier than it sounds. AAAGGGHHH!!!
