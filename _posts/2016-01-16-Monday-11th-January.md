**_Monday 11th January_****_ _**

**_On this first monday of school in the new year we started talking about media and what different types that focus around our lives._**

**_Then Mr Keen gave a bingo sheet; that instead of numbers had questions and we had to go around the room and find the answers to them. For example I might go up to a friend and ask them one of the questions and if they said 'yes' then I would write their name on that question, if not I would ask them a different question until they said yes. _**

**_After that, we discussed the new KIA advert which was very funny and appealing to the eye. We then talked about the target audience and who would be amused or who would use this advert._**

**_After that we looked deeper into this advert and what the subtext was, which is the underlying message that isn't said but implied._**

**_ And last but not least we focused on the untold stories which once again are the things that are left out of this advert, like the things that the company doesn't want you to find out._**
