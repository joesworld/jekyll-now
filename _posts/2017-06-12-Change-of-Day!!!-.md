    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>First of all we are on a different timetable now which means that we are on a Tuesday now, 5th period too, oooh fancy! We are still doing code academy and Javascript though.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson was to take it easy, take a chill pill as some may say. The most important thing however was not to rush.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>For once I finally reached my target, which made me feel very good, however this particular section that I was only really tricked me and that's where  I lost time. But at least it wasn't down to rushing for once.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ironically not rushing was what kept me together and helped me do this task, the reason why I say ironically is because in the last few weeks that is the area that I have been messing up on and because I have focused on it it has allowed me to do well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning, this stupid question and the fact that I got quite annoyed with it in the end as I just couldn't work out what I was not doing right and it was driving me around the bend. I would not normally say this but the main thing that I need to work on for next week is the way I dealt with it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I need to work on for next week is my response to a hard question mentally, as I felt that I challenged this particular question in a bad way and it therefore really impacted my learning as I got frustrated and then couldn’t look att he question in a proper and logical way and in the end it was a really illy mistake but because I was in that particular mindset I couldn’t get past it.</td>
