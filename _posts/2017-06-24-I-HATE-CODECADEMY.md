  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I started of this lesson thinking that it would be easy and it was definitely not, it was fine up until one, just one, question and I couldn't work it out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My original target for the lesson was to go slowly and I did that because I was on this question for the whole lesson. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>As I mentioned in my previous section I did get my target done and this was because it saved my work from last time so I thought that my progress was what was part of the question. </td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This week the thing that I found that actually just starting from scratch would improve my work, this is because it made me go to the right beginning and work on the question from scratch so I could really understand what to do, for a second time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that I didn't accept that maybe sometimes you just have to start from the top and try again because otherwise you might not know where you went wrong, so if you do it another time then you might realise what you did do wrong.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Be calm and donâ€™t get worked up about things. This will improve my learning as it encourages me to go slowly whilst doing my work.</td>
  </tr>
