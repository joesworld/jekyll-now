**Monday 27th June **

This lesson was slightly different to others that we have had before as we were in another classroom and for the first time ever in an IT lesson we didn't use the computers. Well… enough about that instead of doing things on the computers we talked about the kind of things that the younger generation a vulnerable to online and on social media. We particularly covered the subject of revenge porn and sexting and what they were and how we can prevent them. I personally quite enjoyed this lesson as it was something completely different to what we would normally do in an IT lesson. I also learned that I need to be more careful when on social media as I am exposed to a lot more than I bargained for.

Our homework was to find 2 news articles about sexting and revenge porn and post them on our blogs… so here they are.
