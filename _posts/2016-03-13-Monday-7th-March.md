**_Monday 7th March_**

Today in IT we focused on what virus', worms, spyware and trojans are and if you don’t know what they are here are a few quick definitions.

**_XXX_**

**Virus **

A virus is a type of bug (not an insect kind of bug though!) that spreads through a program or a website, this doesn't have to be very bad and all it does it slows down your PC but sometimes it can ruin your data and then you will be in a spot of bother.

**Worms **

These are similar to virus' as they target your PC but they can be slightly worse as they spread from device to device and a good thing about virus’ is they have to hang or latch onto a program but worms don’t making them super speedy when it comes to 'infecting’ a piece of software or a device.

**_Trojans _**

Trojans are sneaky little things as they pretend to be normal safe programming systems but instead they are systems that will be mean and **_SHUT YOU DOWN!!!_**

**_XXX_**

**_Spyware_**

As you can probably gather from the name spyware these are also really sneaky as they creep into your device and steal all your personal information, not really what you want hey.

**There is a way to stop this and this is called security when you get a device always download a really good and reliable set of data security as even if it costs a tiny bit of money then you know you have a smaller chance of being hacked.   **
