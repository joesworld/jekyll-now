**Title **		           The most annoying lesson ever!!!!!

**Date** 			17/8/16

**Starting point **	 It didn't start off as the best of lessons as I was not paying attention to the teacher which led me to get told off, which was not a good idea. Note to self don't get told off next lesson.

**Target for the lesson  ** My target for this lesson was to not forget anything like I did last lesson with my USB stick which would then go to on to affect my learning in the future lessons.

**Did I reach my target** Yes, I did. However this has become a bit of a habit so my target for every single other lesson is to not forget anything especially a USB stick as that is twice that I have forgotten it. Despite this I am pleased I have reached my target

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

Recently me and my partner have worked out a good system, which is that he writes it up on the fuze box and I explain what to do. However in this lesson we felt a bit rushed for time so we decided that he would just copy it straight from the book that we learn from. Of course this is not the best way to understand things however we had already done it the previous week so we felt that it was okay to do it. 

**What limited my learning? What habits do I need to work on?**

What happened last week with me forgetting my USB stick really did affect the way I learned because it made us redo what we had done from the beginning, this meant we were not doing anything new and we weren't learning, which of course affected our learning.

**What can I do next week to better my learning?**

To work on another target which always seems to be my downfall in any subject which is…… To Not Make Stupid Mistakes!!! I know it sounds simple and it should be but it my huge downfall for example at one point I accidentally deleted four lines of important code. (Insert pulling hair out here) But it didn't affect my learning as much as what we were doing wasn't new as we had done it the week before but in the future that might not be as forgivable.
