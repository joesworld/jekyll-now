**Title**			  Is it alright???

**Date			**3/10/16

**Starting Point 	**The starting point for this lesson started of with a long moan from our			 teacher (arrgghhh, I had already done everything so it was really				 boring to listen to) abut our blogs actually. Although afterwards we got			 down to working with the Fuze Box and Raspberry Pi (much more 			 fun.)

**Target for the lesson **My target that I set at the beginning of the lesson was to keep focus			 and not get distracted by other pairs around me. This was one of the			 habits that I felt that I needed to improve on from last week.

**Did I reach my target?  **Yes and no really, I say this because the beginning part was				 around 15-20 minutes long which meant that we didn't get enough 			 time to try out new things as my partner were trying to save what we			 had done previously onto a memory stick which we did not know how 			 to do.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

My partner and I work out a good steady system at first where he would read out to me the code that we had done so far in the four weeks we have been doing this and I would copy that onto the editor so that it could run. Pretty snazzy heyâ€¦ I have found that working together has really helped us get work done quicker and if you look at my first two blog posts of the year I was saying that I needed to let my partner get more involved, this has lead us to working better now.

**What limited my learning? What habits do I need to work on?**

I know that this sounds obvious but I think I needed to listen to my teacher despite the fact that I already knew what he was talking about. I also need to try to work on doing things with my partner as as soon as I didn't know what to do with the memory stick I went over to someone who had done it and I got it them to tell me how to do it.

**What can** **I do next week to better my learning?**

First I need to listen to my teacher even if I do know what he is talking about as he might say something that I do need to listen to.I should use my partner if I am not sure what to do instead of going to another pair and asking them to tell me what to do. This way my partner can get more involved and it can better our learning as we are figuring it out instead of going for the easy way out which is to ask someone else straight away
