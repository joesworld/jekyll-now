  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for the lesson was to find the right level of concentration in my learning, which  i have found to be my downfall in previous weeks. This is because i have either been too concentrated and not let my partner do much work or it was vice-versa and he was doing most of the work because i have been distracted by other sets of people.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I would say that I did reach my target as i felt that we both did around even amounts of work; heading in the right direction. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It is quite interesting a my partner finds it easier to read the code straight off of the booklet that is given to us however I personally find it easier if he reads the code to me because it makes me feel as if we are both doing the work as both of us can't type at once.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This week i felt that did relatively good in terms of things that limited my learning however I think that after we do something or do a stage we will use the last ten minutes changing it and making it look different instead of going to the next stage. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next week i will make sure that me and my partner really do crash through the book and get at further through the book and if that means we don’t necessarily change it that much after we have one stage that's how it will have to be.</td>
