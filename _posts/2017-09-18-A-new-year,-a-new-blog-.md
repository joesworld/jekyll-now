    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I felt I did. The only little thing was that I forgot how to multiply something that isn't next to the cell that I want to do something in. To expand on that point, I also forgot to put dollar signs in the percentage that I wanted to multiply everything by. I needed to do that as it fixes that cell</td>

    <td>When I was stuck, instead of struggling by myself, I went to my Dad who uses Excel Spreadsheets everyday for his work, and Excel Spreadsheets is very similar to Google Spreadsheets. He helped me by showing me how he does percentages and then that triggered something that helped me remember what to do. </td>

    <td>Although I set out to listen, which I did do. I still needed to listen to all of the small things which I missed like the dollar signs and the brackets. I also think that I focused a little too  much on presentation and colour whilst trying to make it look pretty.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I am going to really listen in and make sure that I take note of everything that my teacher says and then reproduce it back into my work. So, I can really show them that I tried and I listened to what they said, because it is always good to make a good first impression on a teacher as then they will be willing to help you in the future.</td>
