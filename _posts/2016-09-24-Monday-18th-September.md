Title  	Making our Raspberry Pi's look pretty					

Date 	18/9/16

Starting point			 			

Target for the lesson		

Did I reach my target?

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?

Me and my partner found it easy to trying to match colours as the booklet we were given had some swatches that helped us see which ones matched and which colours did not.

As well as matching colours we tried changing the worlds that the Pi showed and whilst doing this we found out a way to separate the starts of the words and the ends of the words.

What limited my learning? What habits do I need to work on.

Last week I felt that I took over from my partner and was too bossy, this week however I let him do some more of the work. Despite this however I think that instead of letting him figure things out for himself I told him what to do.

What can I do next week to better my learning?

Just sit back and let my partner do even more of the work so we are doing about 50% each, whilst doing this let him figure things more. As well as this I think that I should not be so reluctant to ask the teacher for help.
