Monday 8th June

Today we started by finishing of all 6 tutorials which were all really fun to make. Soon after that we had to start designing our own game for the micro-bit. The micro-bit is a platform that you can program to do whatever you want and even make our own cool games.

I decided to make a game called catch that fish in which you have collect all the dots which are falling from the ceiling as another flashing dot. Over the last few homeworks I have really enjoyed using the micro-bit.

Here is my plan for my own game that I will be creating.

My Micro-bit game

Name

The name of my game that will be based on the micro-bit will be called 'Catch That Fish'

Purpose

The concept of the game is very simple as little balls will fall from the ceiling/top of the micro-bit and you will have to catch them as another little ball (however you are flashing). At the end of 20 small balls coming down the micro-bit will say how many you caught but the more you get the quicker the balls will come down. Almost like the previous game tutorial 'Quick Finger'.  The way to move is by pressing the A button to go left and the B button to go right.

Number of players

'Catch That Fish' will be a single player game as you will be trying to beat your previous high score and not someone else. However it could be a 2 player game if people took turns and remembered their scores.

Inputs

The inputs to my game will be the to buttons on the micro-bit( A and B)and the mouse. Another input for the game is the commands and instructions that I will give the  micro-bit.

Outputs

The monitor is one of my outputs as otherwise you would not be able to play the game as it does not have a mechanism for sound. The lights on the micro-bit are showing the commands therefore making it an output.

The processes the game will calculate.

To get your score the micro-bit will need to count how many of the fish that you collect in the round of 20 falling fish. Eg. If I catch 14 fish in the round the micro-bit will display the number 14 to show my score.
