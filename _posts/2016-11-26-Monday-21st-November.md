  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Today we had a different lesson as our teacher was not teaching us and another person taught us about something called computational thinking.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for the lesson was to not fall asleep, I am really sorry for saying this but I found the lesson really boring as there was nothing practical to do and the person who was teaching us told us everything instead of letting us figure things out for ourselves.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes i did, it wasn't a very hard target but I felt that it was a fair one because ironically it went against everything our normal teacher tells us, and if you read last week's blog you will understand what i am saying</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would say that comparing this week's lesson compared to other lessons i actually preferred the other lessons as we are always challenged to figure things out for ourselves which strangely i prefer as I think i learn better that way.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The way I learned in this lesson today would be the thing that limited my learning just because apart from listening and writing a few small things down i didnâ€™t feel that I learned in any other way. Some people may like learning this way but i do not.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To be brutally honest I did not feel that there was any thing that  could do to better my learning, i could have asked a few more questions but i did not really feel that I should because what can i ask about when it comes to computational thinking.</td>
