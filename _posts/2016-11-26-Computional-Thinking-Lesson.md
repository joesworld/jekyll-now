**Today we did a lesson on computational thinking and we were faced with these questions so here are my answers.  Something a bit different but the blog for the lesson will also be up, don't worry.**

**	The questions **

1. **What is CT?**

2. **Why do we need to think computationally?**

3. **Any example of CT**

4. **When is a computer most likely to be used when using CT? **

5. **Can computers think?**

6. **What tells a computer what and how to do it? **

7. **What enables you to work out exactly and what to tell the computer to do.**

**My responses/answers**

1. **CT stands for computational thinking and it can be useful, you think like a computer thinks to solve problems.**

2. **It helps us think logically so we can break down problems easier, this helps us think of problems easier.**

3. **We have a disco coming up soon so the organisers of that would have to think computationally to help them figure out individual things which which help them organise it.**

4. **I am not really sure about what this answer should be but I think it should be at the end.**

5. **NO way Jose, they cannot, they only give you the answers that they are given in the first place.**
