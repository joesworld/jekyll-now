**Monday 18th January**

**Today we discussed homosexuality**** and whether the things that we see on 'reality TV' is actually true and not scripted. This was really interesting as many of us thought that is was all fake and a bunch of baloney.** 

**XXX**

**Then we looked at some more videos which actually proved themselves to be wrong, and an example of this is a question asked for the Mcdonald's COE and it was 'why does the food on the adverts look so different compared to the actual food. The answer was in that for the adverts they have FOOD ARTISTS!!!! **
