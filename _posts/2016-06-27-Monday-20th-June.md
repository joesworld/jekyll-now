Monday 20th June

This week we did not carry on with microbit as some people's blogs were not working so instead we were trying to fix them using a system on Github called barry clarkes Jekyll-now. We started of by deleting our previous repository which was the easy part, I didn't mind doing this as it was only a couple of steps to do. This next part was the trickier one as we had to reset all of the things that would make the blog look like we wanted it to, I wasn’t worried as I remembered how to do it from the first time that we did it earlier in the year. However some people might not agree with me as I had to help lots of my friends to make their blog work. I didn’t find this lesson to much of a challenge, the only problem I faced was that I had lots to remember.
