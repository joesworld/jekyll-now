**Title**  	Apple,Apple Apple					

**Date **	25/9/16

**Starting point****			** In today's lesson we used variables for the first time.	

**Target for the lesson	**To let my partner get more involved.		

**Did I reach my target?**	Yes, I did reach my target. We both did the same amount of     				work and we worked together really well.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

The booklet that we are provided with ,along the fuze box, is very helpful and gives us the information that we need to have fun with Raspberry Pi. This booklet gives us the instructions to follow, colours to pick to make our Pi look pretty (see last week's blog for more on that) and pictures showing us what to do and how to do it. As well as using the booklet me and my partner use common sense to try and figure out problems we face. Our last option is to go to the teacher and explain what we have done and what he can help us with.

**What limited my learning? What habits do I need to work on.**

There are other people doing the same thing that me and my partner are doing and I need to try not to get distracted by them as also I know I should have a bit of fun but there is a limit. So I need to get my head down and try to power through the instruction so then I can have fun.

**What can** **I do next week to better my learning?**

I can improve my learning by keeping focus on what I am doing, this will then help me not to get distracted by other pairs and it will mean that I can get things done quicker. It will also mean that it is easier for me and my partner to get things done and if there are any things that either of us don't understand it will give us more time to try and figure things out. Although we will try to keep ourselves to ourselves we wonâ€™t isolate us from other groups and we will still help them and if we need help they are also there.
