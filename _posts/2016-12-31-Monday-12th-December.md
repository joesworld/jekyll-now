  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Today we said "bye, bye" the Fuze boxes and had a fun lesson, very unexpected considering the teacher we have, however he is still a very good teacher; one of the best if you ask me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>It is quite hard to choose a target for the lesson however I think it would be to have fun whilst learning things. The objective of all lessons but today it most relevant as it was meant to be a fun lesson and it was.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to “Lesson Review”)</td>
    <td>Today I most certainly reached the target I set out for myself at the beginning of the lesson, the game that we were allowed to play was called lightbot, and you have to make code for the little robot to follow, so we were still doing IT but in a different way. Here is the link to the game: http://www.abcya.com/lightbot.htm</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the start of the lesson i spent about fifteen minutes trying to work out how to even get to the game as I tried to do something that everyone had done however it didn't seem to co-operate with me so instead I found another website that luckily had the game on it so i could play it. The strategy that worked for me here was perseverance as I didn’t give p and in the end I won.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>With the period of trying to find out how to start the game i think i could have got to a better way quicker as I was doing the same thing over and over again when I knew it didn’t work so I need to be quicker when making important decisions and also it is ok to ask for help from peers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>By not being afraid to ask others and try to think off the top off my head basically meaning that if one thing doesn’t work then think of another thing quickly and see if that works, and I do that until I find an answer to the problem I am facing</td>
