  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Today was the first lesson back after the half term. WooHoo back at school and this week we had our normal teacher back. But unluckily not everything could be good as instead of doing the fuze box  we did or blogs and we fixed them up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To not get distracted by people around me so i can get on with my work more and i can get further on in the booklet and therefore better my learning. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Sadly this week i could not reach my target as there was no possible way that i could s for most, nearly all of the lesson we were talking at the front. </td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My teacher loves telling us to figure things out for ourselves instead of asking him for help, (say next thing in toddler voice) which makes me feel really sadâ€¦.  (say in normal voice) although he does have a point because we have been taught in such a way that we are used to getting things be given to us on a place.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Would say that based on this lesson i could not pick a specific target but overall based on all the lessons it would be to improve my concentration in lessons as this is what seems to affect my learning as i seem to get distracted by other people and i seem to be too concentrated and not involve my partner so i really need to get that balance right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I know this sounds a bit silly but i think trial and error will be the right way to improve my target because getting the right balance of things like concentration is not something you can just click your finger and do you need to do it over a period of time.</td>
