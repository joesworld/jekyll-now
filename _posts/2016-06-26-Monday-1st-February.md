Monday 1st February

Today we did an experiment where our teacher would ask us a question and we would go to a different side of the room depending on our opinions on the question however you could go in between both sides if you felt that you didn't fully agree but you kind of agreed. We did this for the whole lesson as after each question we would discuss why we went in the particular position. An example question that our teacher would ask us is 'do you feel that media and social media has  taken over your life, go to the right side if you agree that it has taken over our lives or go over to the left side if you disagree with this fact'.

I really enjoyed this lesson as it was something completely different to what we would normally do.
