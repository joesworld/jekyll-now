**_Monday 11th July_**

Today we talked about how propaganda is used in newspapers to promote their ideas and to make people look and. So instead of saying 'David Cameron made a mistake' the papers would say ‘ And he has messed up our country again’. Propaganda in newspapers is very common. Here are some examples from this week.

This one hasn't used propaganda necessarily but it has happened due to propaganda in newspapers and on TV. Something so small like the comment about how she should be our PM as she has kids was made into something huge and therefore making her quit the race to be a Prime Minister.

Jeremy Corbyn has lashed out at his labour party threatening them with legal action over rule changes, (I tried using propaganda there, see how easy it is.) This has all occurred due to things being leaked out into public and the reason why Corbyn is so mad that this has happened is because people are looking at the papers looking for something interesting to read and they are only interested because the way that the publisher has put the title therefore making Corbyn look like a right nutter. Would you rather read an article with the headline 'Corbyn has a disagreement with his party' or ,Corbyn threatens his fellow labour party over rule changes which could kick him out as leader.’ I think I have made my point.
