**Title **			Oh No, I left it

**Date** 			10/8/16

**Starting point **	I started the lesson badly as i had forgotten to bring in the USB stick 			that my partner and I were saving our work to, so that meant that we 			would have to redo what we had done today on to the USB stick next			week.

**Target for the lesson  **Last week I didn't feel that I had reached my target so this week I			 	really wanted to try not to get distracted with people around me. 

**Did I reach my target** Yes, I did. I definitely met this target and in fact didn't talk even to any			 other pairs. That is yet another instance where I follow and keep				 doing my target.

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

Since I kept to my target which was not to try to interact with other pairs my partner and I kept our heads down and just worked really hard and because there was no-one distracting us, this meant that we could get more work done

**What limited my learning? What habits do I need to work on?**

I forgot my USB stick so I think I need to try to be more organised before school starts so I can make sure that I don't forget anything like a USB stick again. I can do this by packing my bags the night before so that I can check in the morning and if i canâ€™t find something I have more time to look for it.

**What can I do next week to better my learning?**

I need to try not to forget a USB stick for a start. But I think as much as my target was not to get distracted with other people I think I almost ignored them so my target for next week that will better my learning is to help at least one person as that way I will learn and other people will also learn about how to do things.
