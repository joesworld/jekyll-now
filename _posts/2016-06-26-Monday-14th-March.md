Monday 14th March

To start of the lesson we discussed what we did in the previous lesson which was malware spyware and other things similar to those things. Then we were introduced to a new program called Prezi which is a site that you can use to present things almost like a powerpoint but much better and you can get better results out of it. It has only been the first week but i am already really enjoy using this.

Here is the link to Prezi so you can make your own cool presentations:  [Prezi.com](http://prezi.com/)
