Monday 9th May 

Today we were once again introduced to a new program and this is called Microbit. It is a program set up by the BBC and it is where you are programming your own little 5x5 thing to do different things and create mini games. I am really enjoying using it as it is a fun way of programming. We started a few of the tutorials and i got it straight away and was of like a bullet. I am still re-going over the tutorials even though i have already done my homework. Here is the website microbit: [https://www.microbit.co.uk/](https://www.microbit.co.uk/)
