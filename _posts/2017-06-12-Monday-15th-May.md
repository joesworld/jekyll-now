    <td>I started of this lesson well, I got through a few sections really quickly and then I completely forgot everything and it really set me behind as couldn't remember a thing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson was to get through it all really quickly and get to a further stage than anyone else.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No, not at. I rushed and REALLY messed up. Lesson for next week don’t rush. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt from my mistakes and reflecting on it I shouldn't have rushed as it really impacted my learning because I then didn’t fully understand what I needed to do, but in the end I persevered and it meant that I could finally finish it, which felt really really good. Here I have used two techniques which were perseverance and learning from my mistakes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I mentioned previously and in last weeks blog I talked about rushing and it happened again, I rushed and therefore delayed the time that I had on the easier ones and prolonged the time I had on the harder ones, that sounds good doesn’t it, well...it is not and this is because it meant that I had forgotten the aspects that i needed to improve.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next week I will make sure that I don’t rush, this will mean that I will have more time to get all the things done a I understand it ALL and not just parts of it and then waste my time on unnecessary things that I could fix if I had not been rushing.</td>
