**You're Hired... 							Monday 9th October**

So, in today's lesson we focused on what would happen if this was a real company, so we worked out the costs that would have to be incorporated if this was real; an example being company VAT, taxes, legal fees and most importantly advertising and promotions. 

Then we made a table for our staff by working out how many hours they would work p.a. and then timesed that by their hourly wage, using product, this was quite a simple lesson but it was mainly the ideas that we worked on. But, at the beginning we did finish working on the project that we did the week before, during this period I helped some people who were further behind than me, so this reinforced what I needed to do and I akso helped them as well. 

All in all it was a good lesson, I helped myself, helped other people and finished the bits that I needed to do from the week before…

So, that's it from me, Joe Out…
