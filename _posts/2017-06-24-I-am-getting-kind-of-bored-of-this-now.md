  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>So this week we had a cover teacher which meant I could work on my blog layout, as you may have noticed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for the lesson is to not rush as it impacts my work, this is because I rush my work but then I can't remember what I have to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, in a sense. I say this because for the most of the lesson I was working on my blog, but when when I was I was working through everything slowly but I understood it all.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Lesson Review</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the strategies that I found effective today was taking it slowly (like despacito) and not rushing all of my work like I had done in the previous weeks of IT. This way I understood what I needed to do so next week I can work on my work quicker and in a more effective way.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As much as I enjoyed changing my blog it affected my learning as I couldn't get all of my work done, so even though I got work done because I worked slowly it did. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I felt that when I did my work I did well and I didn't feel that I needed to do anything to improve, the only thing that I could possibly work on would be to use my time in a better way, however that is being really picky.</td>
  </tr>
