  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I started this week really tired and by the end of the lesson I was revitalised because of what I had managed to do, so yeah, I'm pretty happy.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target was to listen to what my teacher was saying and put that into my work. Sounds easy but on a brand new subject it is quite hard to keep up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Hell Yeah!!! I smashed it, which is why I am so pleased with what I managed to do, I syed with what my teacher asked me to do, I was always one of the first to complete a task and I even tried doing something at home, yeah that didnâ€™t work but lets look on the bright side.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Lesson Review</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Listen. That is all I did and all you need to do. It might seem really easy but as I said earlier it is actually harder than it looks, I am not joking here though. On the first few lessons is when you need to listen most, because those lessons are the lesson where you learn the most.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To be honest I wouldn't say that there was anything that held me back in my lesson. What I could do to, maybe, is try to get everything done even quicker so that then whilst everyone else in finishing off I can ask the teacher what I could do to take my work even further so I get an even better grade.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I will do next time is when I am getting on with the work and I understand it, I am going to help other people out with there work, as that way it helps them, because they are stuck and me because it reinforces how to do it in my head.</td>
