## **_My identity map lesson_** 

**Well as far as creating my identity map I felt confident in what I was doing as it was all about  me and what and who I am and who I want to happen/be when I am older, so I felt a lot better about who I will be when I am a mature old man. There was no real worry as sharing my poster/identity map as if someone has a problem with me being who I want to be that does not matter because they can be who they want to be and I can who I do too. **

**Commenting wise I felt fine because I was sensible with what I commented whereas I felt other people could of been nicer in what they said but I guess that is social media for you. However despite quite a few people taking the advantage and being stupid like on social media I liked the anonymous factor of who posted what and others trying to figure out what I posted too. **

**I was quite surprised with what comments I received as the majority were really good but there were three comments which showed just how silly people can be so I guess you can do a form of social media without going on an electrical device. I now know and feel that the way I use social media is right and it is good because you know that your not going to hurt anyones feelings but your not being too lovy-duby.**

**The way I have used social media has definitely changed as I feel that I can be more open on social media as it is not as scary as it seems. **
