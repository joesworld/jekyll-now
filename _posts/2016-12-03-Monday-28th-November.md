  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Today I didn't go to school as I wasn’t feeling very well so instead of just not doing a blog and not keeping everyone updated I could at least do something, so sorry if this is a bit boring. What can I say when I just stayed in bed all day!!!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Ummmmmm…….. I guess you could say tidying my room could count, maybe making pasta by myself for lunch as well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I met my first target with great success, well i thought by my mum obviously disagreed. The second target on the other hand, was not so easy to do as when i went to go check the fridge there was already a sandwich left by my dad, thanks dad!!!</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think over time my tidying room strategies have improved as when I was younger I just used to shove things into the corner and hope my mother would not notice but times have changed and now I actually do tidy my room, I even have a system where I start in one corner and work around leaving the clothes until last.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I know it will be really hard but I should try not to make my room untidy at the start so I don't have to tidy it up what seems like every single other day which as you would guess is REALLY ANNOYING!!!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Based on what I heard from the lesson our teacher told us to do something with a background to make our beautiful blog look even better. So my target if you like before next lesson will be to find out what to do for that, this will then better my learning.</td>
