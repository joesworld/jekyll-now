    <td>I learnt how to build a type a single board computer and how to use Raspberry Pi which was really cool and I really enjoyed putting it together. Me and my partner enjoyed trying to figure out what the pieces were.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work with my partner more as I think I took over and he wasn't really involving him as much. I just need to take a step back and let us both do the work instead of me doing it all.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to do things more individually as as soon as something went wrong me and my partner went to my friends to see what they did right and we did wrong, this probably was not the best way to better my learning and next lesson I will try to be more individual and work as a pair a bit more.</td>
